## What is Fuuz?

Fuuz is a cloud-based industrial operations platform for building custom manufacturing, telemetry, and operations applications. It provides the foundational infrastructure — data modeling, workflow automation, device connectivity, ERP integration, and visualization — so teams can focus on solving operational problems instead of building plumbing.

Every Fuuz application consists of three building blocks:

- **Data Models** — Define your schema, get a full GraphQL API automatically
- **Data Flows** — Server-side logic for automation, integration, and event processing
- **Screens** — Drag-and-drop UI builder for dashboards, forms, tables, and HMIs

Applications are packaged as portable `.fuuz` files and deployed across environments with zero downtime.

## Platform Architecture

```
Enterprise (Organization Root)
└── Tenant (Isolated Environment + Database)
    └── ModuleGroup (Application)
        └── Module (Functional Area)
            ├── Data Models → Auto-generated GraphQL API
            ├── Data Flows → Backend Logic & Integrations
            └── Screens → User Interface
```

Fuuz uses a **dual API architecture**:

| API | Purpose | Schema Owner |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **Application API** | Your custom data models | Developer (via packages) |
| **System API** | Platform infrastructure (Users, Roles, Settings, Connectors) | Fuuz Platform |

Both APIs expose **Relay-style GraphQL** with full query, mutation, and subscription support.

## How Applications Are Deployed

Applications are distributed as `.fuuz` packages — portable tar archives containing:

```
MyApp@1.0.0.fuuz
├── manifest.json        → Identity, version, platform compatibility
├── definition.json      → Export selections, dependency ordering
└── package-data.json    → Models, flows, screens, seed data
```

Deployment ordering is enforced automatically:
**ModuleGroup → Module → Sequences → Data Models → Seed Data → Screens/Flows → Schedules**

---

## Expression Language

Fuuz uses **JSONata** as its primary expression language throughout the platform — in data flow transforms, screen element bindings, validation rules, and event handlers. The platform extends standard JSONata with **182+ custom bindings** for GraphQL queries, date/time handling, string manipulation, math operations, and platform integration.

---

## Multi-Tenancy

Fuuz supports full multi-tenant isolation with five tenant types:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Administration** | Enterprise-level management |
| **Application Development** | Build and test applications |
| **Application** | Production deployment |
| **Custom** | Specialized configurations |
| **Integration** | External system connectivity |

Each tenant has its own database, ensuring complete data isolation between environments.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** at [fuuz.com](https://fuuz.com) to get access to your development environment
2. **Explore the platform** — start with the Module Designer to create your first data models
3. **Build a flow** — connect to your data sources and automate your first workflow
4. **Design a screen** — use the visual Screen Designer to build your UI
5. **Package and deploy** — export your application and deploy across environments
